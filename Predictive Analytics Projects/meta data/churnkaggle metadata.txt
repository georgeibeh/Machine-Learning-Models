in this competition you are provided with pre-processed data. Your data will have a dimension of N x 8.
Fields:

    Customer_ID: Unique ID for each customer.
    Sessions: Connection details for sessions.
    Cell_ID: Cell in which device is being used.
    District_ID: District where device is being used.
    Complaints_U: Complaint feature 1.
    Complaints_R: Complaint feature 2.
    Complaints_W: Complaint feature 3.
    Label

The aim of this competition is to determine weather a customer will churn using usage detail.

Since this is a binary-class problem, you are expected to try linear regression and random forests, and try to minimize the log loss.

The evaluation metric for this competition is log loss. Log loss calculates overall loss by taking the mean log of probability of correct class. The log of 1 is 0, if the probability of belonging to correct is close to 1, less loss is incurred. As the probability of belonging to correct class approaches 0, more loss is added.

You are expected to reduce your log loss.

Submission Format

For every customer in the dataset, submission files should contain three columns: INDEX, PROB_LOYAL and PROB_LEAVE. Every row should have a probability of staying (PROB_LOYAL) and probability of leaving (PROB_LEAVE).

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

index,PROB_LOYAL, PROB_LEAVE
0, 0.5, 0.5
1, 0.7, 0.3
2, 0.2, 0.8
3, 0.35, 0.65
etc.
